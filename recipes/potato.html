    <h2>Steps to prepare the recipe:</h2>
    <h3>1. Prep the Potatoes:

    Peel and dice potatoes into small cubes.

    Rinse and soak in water for 5–10 minutes to remove excess starch (optional).</h3>

    <h3>2. Start the Tempering:

    Heat oil in a pan.

    Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.

    Add cumin seeds, curry leaves, and a pinch of hing (if using).</h3>

    <h3>3. Cook the Potatoes:

    Drain and add the diced potatoes to the pan.

    Add turmeric, red chili powder, and salt.

    Mix well so the spices coat the potatoes.</h3>

    <h3>4. Fry Until Crispy:

    Cook on medium flame, stirring occasionally.

    Fry until potatoes are golden and crisp (15–20 minutes).

    Don’t cover the pan, or they’ll turn soft instead of crispy.</h3>

    <h3>5. Serve:

    Serve hot with rasam rice, sambar, or curd rice.</h3>
